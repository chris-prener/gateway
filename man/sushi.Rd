\description{
A selection of sushi resturants in the St. Louis, Missouri region.
   These data are in long form, with multiple visits in a single year to some
   of the resturants. They also contain a degree of messiness, with a mix of
   upper and lower case tying, some street types abbreviated (i.e. "St") and
   others entered in full (i.e. "Street"), and an example of two ways in which
   unit numbers may appear.
